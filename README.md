[![Portal](https://img.shields.io/gradle-plugin-portal/v/org.cthing.cthing-versioning?label=Plugin%20Portal&logo=gradle)](https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/org.cthing.cthing-versioning)

A Gradle plugin that establishes the versioning scheme for C Thing Software projects. The plugin
enforces the following:

* The project version is an instance of the ProjectVersion class
* Release builds do not depend on snapshot versions of C Thing Software artifacts

## Usage

The plugin is available from the
[Gradle Plugin Portal](https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/org.cthing.cthing-versioning) and can be
applied to a Gradle project using the `plugins` block:

```kotlin
buildscript {
    repositories {
        mavenCentral()
    }
}

plugins {
  id("org.cthing.cthing-versioning") version "2.0.0"
}
```

## Compatibility

The following Gradle and Java versions are supported:

| Plugin Version | Gradle Version | Minimum Java Version |
|----------------|----------------|----------------------|
| 2.0.0+         | 8.0+           | 17                   |

## Building

The plugin is compiled for Java 17. If a Java 17 toolchain is not available, one will be downloaded.

Gradle is used to build the plugin:
```bash
./gradlew build
```
The Javadoc for the plugin can be generated by running:
```bash
./gradlew javadoc
```
